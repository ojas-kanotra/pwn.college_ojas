
# Compact Linux Cheat-sheet: Real Examples & Forgotten Tips

**arguments**
Arguments are the inputs you provide to commands, separated by spaces. They tell the command what to act on or how to behave.
Example: `ls -l /tmp` lists files in `/tmp` with details. Use quotes for arguments with spaces: `grep "hello world" file.txt`.
Arguments can be filenames, options, or patterns, and are essential for customizing command behavior.

**absolute-paths**
Absolute paths begin with `/` and point to a location from the root of the filesystem, making them unambiguous.
Example: `/usr/bin/python3` runs Python from anywhere, regardless of your current directory.
Use absolute paths when you need to reference files or executables reliably across scripts and commands.

**explicit-relative (./)**
Explicit relative paths use `./` or `../` to specify files or executables relative to your current directory.
Example: `./script.sh` runs a script in the current folder; `../program` accesses one level up.
This avoids confusion with similarly named files elsewhere and ensures you run the intended file.

**home (~)**
The tilde `~` represents your home directory, a shortcut for user-specific files and folders.
Example: `cd ~/Downloads` quickly navigates to your Downloads folder from anywhere.
Useful for scripts and commands that need to work across different user accounts.

**cd**
`cd` changes your current working directory, letting you navigate the filesystem.
Example: `cd /var/log` moves to system logs; `cd ..` goes up one level. `cd -` toggles between last two directories.
Mastering `cd` is key for efficient movement and file management in the shell.

**ls**
`ls` lists files and directories, with options to control format and sorting.
Example: `ls -lh` shows sizes in readable units; `ls -ltr` sorts by modification time, newest last.
Use `ls` to explore directory contents and check file details quickly.

**cat**
`cat` displays the contents of files, useful for quick viewing or combining files.
Example: `cat file.txt` prints the file; for large files, use `less` or `head` to avoid overwhelming output.
Great for inspecting logs, configs, or chaining file contents in scripts.

**grep**
`grep` searches for patterns in files or input, making it essential for finding information fast.
Example: `grep error logfile.txt` finds lines with "error"; `grep -r TODO .` searches recursively. Use `-i` for case-insensitive, `-n` for line numbers, `-v` to exclude matches.
Master regex and options for powerful text processing and troubleshooting.

**diff**
`diff` compares files line by line, showing differences and changes between them.
Example: `diff file1.txt file2.txt` highlights additions, deletions, and changes; `diff -u` gives unified output for patches.
Use with process substitution to compare command outputs directly, streamlining troubleshooting and version control.

**ls -a**
`ls -a` lists all files, including hidden ones that start with a dot (`.`).
Example: `ls -a` reveals config files and folders not shown by default.
Essential for finding system or application settings and debugging issues.

**touch**
`touch` creates empty files or updates the modification time of existing ones.
Example: `touch new.txt` makes a new file; running again updates its timestamp.
Useful for scripting, placeholder files, or triggering automated tasks.

**rm**
`rm` deletes files and directories permanently, with no trash or undo.
Example: `rm file.txt` removes a file; `rm -r folder/` deletes a folder and its contents. Use `-i` for confirmation before deleting.
Always double-check before using `rm`, especially with wildcards or recursive options.

**mv**
`mv` moves files or directories, and can also rename them in place.
Example: `mv old.txt new.txt` renames a file; `mv file.txt folder/` moves it to another folder.
Efficient for organizing, refactoring, or batch renaming files.

**mkdir**
`mkdir` creates new directories, with options for nested folder creation.
Example: `mkdir newdir` makes a single folder; `mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild` builds a full path at once.
Use for project setup, organizing files, or preparing directory structures in scripts.

**find**
`find` searches for files and directories based on name, type, size, and more, recursively.
Example: `find . -name '*.log'` finds all log files; `find /tmp -type d` lists directories. Use `-exec` to run commands on results.
Powerful for automation, cleanup, and locating files in large projects.

**man / --help**
`man` shows manual pages for commands, while `--help` gives quick usage info directly in the terminal.
Example: `man grep` opens the full manual; `grep --help` lists options and examples. Use `/pattern` to search inside man pages.
Essential for learning new commands, troubleshooting, and finding advanced options.

**help (builtins)**
`help` provides documentation for shell built-in commands, which may not have separate manual pages.
Example: `help cd` explains directory changes; `help` alone lists all builtins.
Use to understand shell-specific features and differences from external programs.

**globbing (* ? [])**
Globbing uses wildcards to match multiple files or patterns, saving time and keystrokes.
Example: `ls *.txt` lists all text files; `ls file?.txt` matches single-character variations. Use `[ab]*.txt` for files starting with `a` or `b`.
Quotes prevent unwanted expansion, useful for literal matches or scripting.

**tab-completion**
Tab completion speeds up typing by auto-filling filenames, commands, or options.
Press Tab once to complete; twice to list all possibilities. Works for files, folders, and executables.
Reduces errors and helps discover available commands or files quickly.

**> and >>**
`>` and `>>` redirect command output to files, either overwriting (`>`) or appending (`>>`).
Example: `echo hi > file.txt` replaces content; `echo bye >> file.txt` adds to the end. Use `> /dev/null` to discard output.
Essential for logging, automation, and controlling where results are stored.

**<**
`<` redirects a file's contents as input to a command, replacing standard input.
Example: `sort < file.txt` sorts lines from the file instead of typing them manually.
Useful for automating tasks and processing files in scripts.

**2> and 2>&1**
`2>` redirects error messages (stderr) to a file, while `2>&1` merges errors with normal output (stdout).
Example: `command 2> errors.txt` saves errors; `command > out.txt 2>&1` combines everything in one file.
Vital for debugging, logging, and capturing all output for review.

**|**
`|` pipes the output of one command into another, creating powerful data processing chains.
Example: `cat file.txt | grep error | sort | uniq -c` filters and counts errors. Use with `less` for paging through large results.
Pipes enable modular workflows and efficient command chaining.

**tee**
`tee` splits output, saving it to a file while also displaying it in the terminal.
Example: `ls | tee files.txt` logs and shows results; `tee -a` appends instead of overwriting.
Great for debugging pipelines or keeping a record of command output.

**process substitution**
Process substitution lets you use command output as if it were a file, without creating temporary files.
Example: `diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)` compares directory listings directly.
Ideal for advanced scripting and comparing dynamic data.

**mkfifo**
`mkfifo` creates a named pipe (FIFO), allowing two processes to communicate through a file-like interface.
Example: `mkfifo mypipe`; then use `cat < mypipe` to read and `echo hi > mypipe` to write.
Useful for inter-process communication and advanced shell scripting.

**VAR=$(cmd)**
`VAR=$(cmd)` assigns the output of a command to a variable, enabling dynamic scripting.
Example: `files=$(ls *.txt)` stores filenames in `files` for later use.
Preferred over backticks for nesting and readability in modern shell scripts.

**VAR=value**
`VAR=value` sets a shell variable, which you can reference later with `$VAR`.
Example: `MYVAR=hello` creates a variable; use `$MYVAR` to access its value. No spaces around `=`!
Variables are essential for storing data, customizing scripts, and passing information between commands.

**read**
`read` takes input from the user or a file and stores it in a variable.
Example: `read name` waits for user input; `read line < file.txt` reads the first line of a file.
Crucial for interactive scripts and processing file contents efficiently.

Use `command > filename` to send command output to a file.

**file creation**  
Redirection automatically creates the target file if it doesn't exist.

**content replacement**  
Using `>` overwrites existing file content completely.

**example usage**  
`echo hi > asdf` redirects the output "hi" to the file "asdf".

**universal redirection**  
Any command's output can be redirected, not just `echo`.

**general syntax**  
Use `command > file` pattern for any command.

**append mode benefits**  
`>>` allows accumulating output from multiple commands in the same file.

**workflow applications**  
Often used to aggregate multiple command outputs for later analysis with tools like `grep`.

**content preservation**  
Using `>>` prevents accidental loss of previous command outputs.

**memory streaming**  
Data flows through memory rather than being written to disk.

**file descriptor redirection**  
The `>` operator redirects file descriptors to files, `2>` redirects stderr.

**pipe limitation**  
The `|` operator only redirects stdout, there's no `2|` for stderr.

**file descriptor merging**  
The `>&` operator redirects one file descriptor to another file descriptor.

**two-step error piping**  
First redirect stderr to stdout (`2>&1`), then pipe the combined stream (`|`).

**stream merging**  
Combining stderr and stdout allows both to be processed by the same pipeline.

**advanced redirection**  
Essential technique for processing error messages through text processing tools.

**invert match (-v)**  
`grep -v PATTERN` shows lines that do *not* match PATTERN (inverse of normal `grep` behavior).

**practical filtering**  
Use `command | grep -v PATTERN` to remove unwanted lines (e.g., decoys) from a stream.

**combine safely**  
Pair `grep -v` with `grep`, `sort`, or `uniq` for multi-stage filtering (e.g., remove decoys then find the specific flag).

**exact vs partial matching**  
Quote patterns when they contain special characters or spaces to avoid shell expansion and get exact matches.

**debugging pipelines**  
Use `tee` to inspect intermediate data in a pipeline without interrupting the flow to downstream commands.

**multiple destinations**  
`tee` lets you both save a copy to disk and continue piping to the next command.

**non-destructive inspection**  
Useful when you need to log or view data in-flight while still delivering it to the final consumer.

**compare streams directly**  
Use `diff <(cmd1) <(cmd2)` to compare command outputs without creating intermediate files.

**named pipe interface**  
The shell exposes the command output as `/dev/fd/N` (a file descriptor path) for the duration of the command.

**cleaner workflows**  
Process substitution keeps the filesystem cleaner and avoids race conditions from manually creating temporary files.

**when to use**  
Ideal when tools expect filenames but you want to supply dynamically generated content.

**output process substitution**  
`>(cmd)` runs `cmd` and provides a filename that accepts data written into the command's stdin (useful for writing to commands as if they were files).

**combine tee and >(...)**  
Use `command | tee >(cmd1) >(cmd2)` to send the same stream to multiple consuming commands.

**flexible topologies**  
Process substitution allows building complex pipelines where output can be routed to multiple commands without temporary files.

**tool compatibility**  
Useful when target commands accept filenames rather than reading from stdin.

**stdout piping**  
The `|` operator routes the left command's stdout into the right command's stdin.

**redirecting specific streams**  
Use `2> >(...)` to send stderr into a process substitution or `2>file` to send it to a file, while piping stdout normally.

**split topology**  
Combining redirections with process substitution enables routing stderr and stdout to different consumers simultaneously.

**practical use**  
Useful for separating informational output from error messages when feeding different handlers.

**creation and identification**  
Create one with `mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo`. `ls -l` shows a leading `p` in the permission string for FIFOs.

**blocking behavior**  
Reads and writes block until both ends are connected—writers wait for readers and vice versa.

**transient data**  
Data sent through a FIFO is not stored persistently; it is consumed by readers and disappears.

**use cases**  
Useful for coordinating between two processes (e.g., producer writes into FIFO, consumer reads from it) without temporary files.

**variable access**  
Print variables using `echo` by prepending the variable name with `$`.

**dollar sign usage**  
The `$` symbol tells the shell to access the variable's value, not its name.

**built-in variables**  
The shell provides built-in variables like `PWD` (current working directory).

**variable substitution**  
The shell replaces `$VARIABLE` with the variable's actual value during command execution.

**common practice**  
Using `echo $VARIABLE` is the standard way to display variable contents.

**variable assignment syntax**  
Use `VAR=VALUE` to set variable values (similar to other programming languages).

**no spaces rule**  
Never put spaces around the `=` sign in variable assignments.

**space consequences**  
Spaces like `VAR = 1337` make the shell try to run `VAR` as a command instead.

**assignment vs access**  
Use `VAR=value` to set variables, `$VAR` to access their values.

**immediate effect**  
Variable assignments take effect immediately in the current shell session.

**space handling**  
Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting spaces as command separators.

**string preservation**  
Quotes preserve the exact spacing and content of multi-word strings.

**quote types**  
Can use double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`) depending on needs.

**security isolation**  
Local variables prevent sensitive data from leaking to other programs accidentally.

**export mechanism**  
Use `export` command to make variables available to child processes.

**environment variables**  
Exported variables become environment variables for child processes.

**process inheritance**  
Child processes inherit exported variables but not local ones.

**env command**  
The `env` command prints all exported environment variables in the current shell.

**environment inspection**  
Useful for debugging and understanding what variables are available to child processes.
