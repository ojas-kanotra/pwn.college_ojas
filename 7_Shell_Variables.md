# Shell Variables

## Printing Variables
Have your shell print out the FLAG variable and solve this challenge!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wNUAT11SDmP3Z6O1E4sqH8PM1Kf.QX3UTN0wyM3kjNzEzW}`


```bash
command echo $FLAG
pwn.college{wNUAT11SDmP3Z6O1E4sqH8PM1Kf.QX3UTN0wyM3kjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
You can also print out variables with echo, by prepending the variable name with a $. For example, there is a variable, PWD, that always holds the current working directory of the current shell.

## Setting Variables
To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Be careful: both the names and values of variables are case-sensitive! PWN is not the same as pwn and COLLEGE is not the same as College.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ywxeyat_fOujK1VEkUmilZh2VDP.QX5UTN0wyM3kjNzEzW}`


```bash
command PWN=COLLEGE
pwn.college{Ywxeyat_fOujK1VEkUmilZh2VDP.QX5UTN0wyM3kjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
- Just like many other languages you can use VAR=SOMETHING to set the value
- Note that there are no spaces around the =! If you put spaces (e.g., VAR = 1337), the shell won't recognize a variable assignment and will, instead, try to run the VAR command
- Also note that this uses VAR and not $VAR: the $ is only prepended to access variables
